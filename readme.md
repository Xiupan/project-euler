# Project Euler
This repo serves as a log of my attempts to solve Project Euler problems with Javascript (and maybe some other languages!). It's mission: to prepare myself for tech interviews.

I'm just running the JS scripts with Node right now. That may change as the problems become increasingly complex.

## Where are the problems?
Go to [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## TODO:
- Add testing library with npm/yarn?
